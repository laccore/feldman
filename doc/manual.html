<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Feldman is a software utility developed by LacCore/CSDCO to simplify the process of aligning and splicing core sections, and exporting measurement data based on a splice.</p>
<h3 id="convert-sparse-splice-to-sit">Convert Sparse Splice to SIT</h3>
<p>Given a section summary and sparse splice, Feldman will generate an affine table and splice interval table (SIT).</p>
<p>The generated affine and SIT are written to the same directory as the input sparse splice file. They use the sparse splice's filename plus &quot;-affine&quot; or &quot;-SIT&quot;. For example, for a sparse splice file named MySparseSplice.csv, the resulting affine and SIT are named MySparseSplice-affine.csv and MySparseSplice-SIT.csv, respectively.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;...&quot; buttons to select section summary and sparse splice files as input.</p>
<p>By default, Feldman determines the affine offset of off-splice cores by finding the nearest on-splice core in the same hole and using that offset.</p>
<p>If a manual correlation table is provided, those alignments will be used for off-splice cores rather than the default.</p>
<p>Use Scaled Depths: if checked, the section summary's scaled depths will be used to map section depth to total depth. Unscaled depths are the default.</p>
<p>Lazy Append: if checked, for an APPEND operation, the affine shift of the previous core in the splice will be used for the current core, even if they're from different holes. By default, the gap between the previous core's bottom and the current core's top will be computed in scaled depth and used for the current core's affine shift.</p>
<p>Once input data and options are selected, click Convert. Major steps of the conversion process will be noted in the Log window. If the &quot;Include Debugging Information&quot; checkbox is checked, a far more detailed account of the process is provided, which can be helpful in the case of errors or unexpected outputs.</p>
<h3 id="splice-measurement-data">Splice Measurement Data</h3>
<p>Given an affine and splice interval table (SIT), and one or more measurement data files, Feldman will splice each measurement data file, generating a new file including only rows whose Depth is within the range of a splice interval.</p>
<p>The spliced measurement data is written to the same directory as the input measurement data file, with a &quot;-spliced&quot; suffix. For example, for measurement data files MyProject_XRF.csv and MyProject_MSCL.csv, MyProject_XRF-spliced.csv and MyProject_MSCL-spliced.csv will be generated.</p>
<p>Three columns are added to the generated file:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Splice Depth: the CCSF-A depth of the measurement
  Offset: the affine shift of the core in which the measurement was taken
  On-Splice: TRUE or FALSE, indicating whether the measurement is on-splice</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If the input file contains a &quot;Section ID&quot; column, these columns will be inserted to its right on output. Otherwise they'll be inserted in the leftmost position.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;...&quot; buttons to select input affine and SIT files.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;Add/Remove&quot; buttons to add/remove one or more measurement data files to the list.</p>
<p>Select the column to use as the Depth Column for each measurement data file to be spliced.</p>
<p>Off Splice: if checked, rows of data that are off-splice are included with On-Splice value FALSE.</p>
<p>Whole Section Splice: if checked, all rows of data from on-splice core sections will be included with On-Splice value TRUE. For example, consider a splice interval with top section 1 at depth 20cm and bottom section 2 at depth 90cm. If Whole Section is checked, <em>all</em> measurements from section 1 and 2 will be included, even those above 20cm in section 1 and those below 90cm in section 2. Measurements from section 3, however, will <em>not</em> be included because that section isn't part of the splice interval.</p>
<p>Once input data and options are selected, click Splice Data. Major steps of the splicing process will be noted in the Log window. If the &quot;Include Debugging Information&quot; checkbox is checked, a far more detailed account of the process is provided, which can be helpful in the case of errors or unexpected outputs.</p>
<h3 id="file-formats">File Formats</h3>
<p>Feldman reads and writes tabular data files in comma-separated values (CSV) format.</p>
<p>Templates for all formats can be found in the templates folder alongside the Feldman application. Examples of all formats can be found in the examples folder.</p>
<p>General requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first row of a file must be a header row with a name for each column.</li>
<li>All subsequent rows must be data rows; no additional rows (e.g. units, comments) are allowed.</li>
<li>Spaces, case, and parenthesized units are ignored when checking required columns. For example, &quot;Top Depth&quot;, &quot;Top Depth (m)&quot;, and &quot;topdepth&quot; are all valid names for the required Section Summary &quot;Top Depth&quot; column.<br />
</li>
<li>One or more non-required columns are allowed if their names are unique.</li>
<li>Columns can be in any order.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identity-columns">Identity Columns</h4>
<p>All formats use some or all of the following columns to identify cores and/or sections:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Site: An integer &gt; 0 representing the collection site  
  Hole: One or more capital letters (A, B, ..., Y, Z, AA, AB...) representing a single drilled hole  
  Core: An integer &gt; 0 representing an interval of material collected from parent hole  
  Tool: A single capital letter representing the drilling tool used to collect the core  
  Section: An integer &gt; 0 representing a post-extraction subdivision of a core</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="section-summary">Section Summary</h4>
<p>A section summary table contains one row for each section in a project. It is used to translate section depths to total depth, and as a &quot;master list&quot; of a project's core sections. Sections that may not be included in a splice, but are part of measurement data to be spliced, should be included.</p>
<p>A section summary must include the following columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Identity Columns: Site, Hole, Core, Tool, and Section  
  Top Depth: Top depth of the section, in meters (m)
  Bottom Depth: Bottom depth of the section, in meters (m)
  Top Depth Scaled: Scaled (in situ) top depth of the section, in meters (m) 
  Bottom Depth: Scaled (in situ) bottom depth of the section, in meters (m)
  Curated Length: Length of the curated section, in meters (m)</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It may optionally include:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Gaps: One or more [top]-[bottom] pairs separated by spaces, each indicating a gap in the section
  in centimeters (cm). For example, 10-20 indicates a single gap from 10-20cm section depth.
  30-40 60-62.5 80-97 indicates three gaps: 30-40cm, 60-62.5cm, and 80-97cm. Leave value empty for
  sections with no gaps.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="sparse-splice">Sparse Splice</h4>
<p>A sparse splice table contains one row for each interval of a sparse splice. Each interval is defined only in section depths, not total depths. The term &quot;sparse&quot; comes from the lack of total depths.</p>
<p>A sparse splice table must include the following columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Identity Columns: Site, Hole, Core, and Tool
  Top Section: section in which the interval begins
  Top Offset: section depth at which interval beings, in centimeters (cm)
  Bottom Section: section in which the interval ends
  Bottom Offset: section depth at which interval ends, in centimeters (cm)
  Splice Type: TIE or APPEND</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It may optionally include:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Data Used: Data type used to define this interval
  Comment: User remarks
  Gap: User-defined gap between current and preceding interval, in meters (m). Overrides default APPEND behavior.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="affine-table">Affine Table</h4>
<p>An affine table contains one row for every core in a project. Each row indicates the core's affine shift distance and associated metadata.</p>
<p>An affine table must include the following columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Identity Columns: Site, Hole, Core, and Tool
  Depth CSF-A: Depth of the top of the core, in meters (m)
  Depth CCSF-A: Shifted/composite depth of the top of the core, in meters (m)
  Offset: Distance of core shift, in meters (m). Positive values indicate a downward shift, negative upward.
  Shift Type: Core&#39;s shift type. Valid values are TIE, SET, REL, or ANCHOR.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It may optionally include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Differential Offset: Difference between the offset of the current core and the previous core in the hole, in meters (m)
  Growth Rate: Ratio of core&#39;s CCSF-A depth to its CSF-A depth
  Fixed Core: For a TIE operation, the Hole and Core of the fixed core, e.g. A1, B12, C87
  Fixed Tie CSF-A: The CSF-A depth of the tie point on the fixed core, in meters (m)
  Shifted Tie CSF-A: The CSF-A depth of the tie point on the shifted core, in meters (m)
  Data Used: Data type used to shift the core
  Comment: User remarks</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>All columns will be included in the affine generated by the Sparse to SIT operation.</p>
<h4 id="splice-interval-table-or-sit">Splice Interval Table, or SIT</h4>
<p>A splice interval table contains one row for each interval of a splice. It is a superset of a sparse splice. In addition to section depths for the top and bottom of each interval, it includes the total depths in CSF-A and CCSF-A.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Identity Columns: Site, Hole, Core, and Tool
  Top Section: section in which the interval begins
  Top Offset: section depth at which interval begins, in centimeters (cm)

</blockquote>
<p>It may optionally include:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Data Used: Data type used to define this interval
  Comment: User remarks
  Gap: User-defined gap between current and preceding interval, in meters (m). Overrides default APPEND behavior.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>All columns will be included in the splice interval table generated by the Sparse to SIT operation.</p>
<h4 id="manual-correlation-table">Manual Correlation Table</h4>
<p>A manual correlation table contains one or more rows of data, each indicating a user-defined alignment of an off-splice core with an on-splice core. The resulting affine shift will override the default affine shift for the off-splice core. Each row consists of two sets of Identity Columns, and the point on each core to be aligned.</p>
<p>A manual correlation table must include the following columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Site1: The off-splice site
  Hole1: The off-splice hole
  Core1: The off-splice core
  Tool1: The off-splice tool
  Section1: The off-splice section
  SectionDepth1: Section depth of the off-splice section to be aligned with on-splice section

  Hole2: The on-splice hole
  Core2: The on-splice core
  Tool2: The on-splice tool
  Section2: The on-splice section
  SectionDepth2: Section depth of the on-splice section to be aligned with off-splice section</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="measurement-data">Measurement Data</h4>
<p>A measurement data table contains one or more measurements taken at a given depth in a core section.</p>
<p>A measurement data table must include the following columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>  Identity Columns: Site, Hole, Core, Tool, Section indicating the source of the measurement(s)
  [Depth Column]: total depth of the measurement(s) of the core section, in meters (m). Depths
  in the specified column will be used to determine whether a measurement is within a splice interval.</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The Depth Column is selected in the Splice Measurement Data dialog, and can have any name. The only requirement is that the Depth Column must contain only numeric values. If any alphabetic characters are included in a column (other than its name), it cannot be selected as the Depth Column.</p>
<p>Any number of measurement columns and additional columns (comments etc.) may be included. They will be included unaltered in the output of Splice Measurment Data.</p>
