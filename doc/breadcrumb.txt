Feldman documentation is written in Markdown. For deployment it's converted to HTML using
the fabulous pandoc utility (http://pandoc.org) with the following command:

pandoc -f markdown-smart -t html manual.markdown > manual.html

-smart is appended to markdown to stifle output of curly apostrophes and quotes, which
Chrome interprets correctly but Firefox does not. They're too fancy for this manual anyway!
